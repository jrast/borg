Borg Native on Windows
======================

Build Requirements
------------------

- VC 14.0 Compiler
- OpenSSL Library (https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)
- Patience and a lot of coffee / beer

What's working
--------------

- Borg does not crash if called with ``borg``
- ``borg init --encryption none ./demoRepo`` runs without an error/warning.
   Note that only relative paths work at the moment.
